3. Use command java -jar release-manager-1.2.jar -key "key.json" -file "app.apk" -track "internal" -name "myApp" -notes "new release". (You can use this command in your cloud build config file)


## Usage

### 1. Setup Play Store

Ensure that the app is created on Play Store. Setup Play Store listing and other required information so that release management is enabled and new releases can be published. It is advised to do a manual upload and release at least once in the beginning.
